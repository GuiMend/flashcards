# Project Flashcards Udacity

## Getting Started / How to run

You need Node.js to run project. We recommend the most recent version.

After fetching this repository, install all dependencies with:

    npm install

And start the webapp using:

    npm start

To run in your iOS simulator use:

    npm run ios

Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.
